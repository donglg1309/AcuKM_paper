#Script Lists:

#1, The counts in bdg files were normalized to FPKM value with an in-house bash script 

#2, The identified summits were mapped to the annotation of the Aspergillus nidulans FSGC genome version ‘s10-m04-r03’, excluding tRNAs and rRNAs using an in-house R-script package (https://github.com/donglg1309/AcuKM_paper) along with the summit annotation function ‘annotatePeaks.pl’ from the homer package;

#3, Heatmaps of gene expression and figures for the results of GO, principal component analysis (PCA), and correlation analysis were plotted using an in-house R-script;

#4, Gene Ontology Script;
